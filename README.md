# ToolBar

ToolBar adds one or several toolbars on your desktop that you can move as you please, and add any shortcuts you with to. 
In the ToolBar folder, there is a folder named "Folders", add any shortcut you wish to add in here. rename the files as you see fit and they will automatically be added to the toolbar.
